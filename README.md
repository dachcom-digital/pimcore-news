# Pimcore News
Pimcore News Bundle. Generate simple [custom entry types](docs/20_EntryTypes.md) like Events, Press or Event.

## Requirements
⚠️⚠️ This extension has reached its end of life and only receives compatibility update. It will not be developed further.

## Installation

```json
"require" : {
    "dachcom-digital/news" : "~3.0.0",
}
```

- Execute: `$ bin/console pimcore:bundle:enable NewsBundle`
- Execute: `$ bin/console pimcore:bundle:install NewsBundle`

## Important to know
- The detail url is based on the title for each language. If the detail url field is empty, the title will be transformed to a valid url slug.
- The News Bundle will install two classes (`NewsEntry` and `NewsCategory`). If you're going to modify them, please make sure that you're follow our [upgrade notes](UPGRADE.md) in case we're changing the class structure.

## Good to know
- News can be placed at any place on your website through the news area element. Use it as list, latest or even as a custom layout.
- The detail page always stays the same (see static route), no matter where you placed the area element.
- It's possible to override the detail url in the news object.
